dear data professionals, 

it has been a week since our last forum event, and things have been moving fast.

for those who missed it, we announced that have started this a collaborative data project, and you are all invited to help out. this project is something new for the forum. something we haven't tried to do before. it will be a learning exercise as well as a useful contribution to the ladies that ux (ltux) conference this fall.

it's an experiment. the outcome is far from guaranteed. but i promise you that all participants will learn something in the process. so i would like as many of you as possible to be a part of this and to receive those valuable lessons.

- do you know how to use the relevant technologies? would you like to?
- have you never built a web page scraper but can see how it would be a useful skill to have? come on in, let's figure it out together. 
- do you have strong opinions on how to model disparate datasets in a unified data warehouse? come on in, we'll listen.
- do you have a hidden talent for writing documentation? fantastic! boy, will you be popular!
- do you have a favourite analytics tool, methods, or trick you love crowing about? come on in, show us!
- do you love research projects and get the high of finding things out when an analysis comes together and reveals insights? are you addicted to discovery? come on in, the first dose is free. (in fact they're all free).

this is a chance both for experienced and talented data professionals to contribute their skills to and for beginners to learn and build their portfolio. but nothing at all, none of this happens without you, without your participation so please help us out.

- join us on slack, channel #hackastroll, where we will be organising the effort. if you haven't already joined our slack, here is your invite: https://join.slack.com/t/brighton-data/shared_invite/zt-35qn1gnvp-KqpSPnWQDIECPh7m8sJoJg
