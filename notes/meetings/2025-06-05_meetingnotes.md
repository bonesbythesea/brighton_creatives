# data cleaning and processing
ons data with odd shaped header, hard to bring into 
 oskar showed how to read and analyse ons csv files (python notebook). more file types need cleaning code. especially excel. and loaded duckdb database loaded.

need to focus the search for information. look for one of these:

1. how much is being spent in public grants?
2. where is this money going to? what else can we know about the areas where the grants are going? median income, demographics, etc.
3. we have found over 400 empty spaces in brighton. how many of these are artistic places
